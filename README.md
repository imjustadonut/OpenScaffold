# OpenScaffold
OpenScaffold is an open-source scaffold creator for codes and organizing codespaces. Made in python for simplest functionality.

**Auto-Setup**
> We have included a free quick-start file that is a click-and-go. It will install all required functionallities for OpenScaffold to work!
> Please ensure you install Python 3.11 (OR LATER) before using the auto-setup script. Python is the one requirement that we cannot setup for you!
> More at [Python's Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## To Use (WITH AUTO-SETUP SCRIPT)
> Download Python 3.11 (OR LATER)
> Simply download the auto-setup file from the ScaffoldScripts folder.
> Use the keybind `WIN + R`, paste the command `powershell`
> Once your in powershell, type the following:
```bash
PS C:\> mkdir OpenScaffold
PS C:\> cd OpenScaffold
PS C:\OpenScaffold> git clone "https://github.com/imjustadonut/OpenScaffold/main" ./
```
And thats quite literally it! The rest is done for you, by us.

Note: If you're using Mac or Linux, simply run the same commands, just using your native terminal rather than `Windows Powershell`!
